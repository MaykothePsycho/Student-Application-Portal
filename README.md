# Student-Application-Portal 

This project was the last of the many projects I did in the 6-month software training I received. 

The project, where I used React and Node.js technologies, is a portal where erasmus students are informed about the trainings they will receive in the school they come from. The portal opens with a nicely designed login/signup page. After successfully logging in, the user is directed to the portal content.

Apart from the information pages where we can see the necessary information, the portal has the following features:

1. Application form page: The application form required to participate in the trainings is accessed from this page and the form information is kept in the local database in the repository.

2. Password change and application change: These operations are available on the "user" page. 

Any kind of feedback would be very helpful for me. 
Thanks in advance.
